## About This Repository

This is the official open-source code of the NASA Space Apps Challenge team, Sink or Swim. The SOS project is an easy-to-use way for people to develop their own, custom checklists – both items and plans – for specific kinds of disasters. Use NASA images, videos, or data visualizations to illustrate each disaster type, to help people understand how to prepare.
